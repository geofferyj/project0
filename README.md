# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project has five (5) html pages with a navigation bar on each page.

The first page is my home page with a Header and an image.
The next page is my About page which contains an ordered and an unordered list and some paragraphs
The Contacts page follows next with a contact form and a submit button.
following this is the Table page with a sample table with random data
and last is a coming soon page.

The color theme is composed of several shades of gray (as I am not very good with colors)
