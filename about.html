                <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
                <p>

                    I am Geoffery Joseph, a hard working industrous and delegent student of the department
                    of Computer Science in the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.
                    I've always loved technology and other related fields, once, I actually
                    wanted to be a medical doctor, but that all changed when I saw a computer for the first time in
                    primary    4. Granted it was an old windows 98 desktop computer but it was the most marvelous thing I'd ever
                    seen
                    and I was hooked. <br>

                    Fast forward a couple years and here I am studying to become a computer scientist.
                </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>

                    I love automation and learning how things work, so as soon as I was able, I started dabbling in
                    things like:
                    <ol>
                        <li>web Design with html 4 and css 2</li>
                        <li>Game Design with Unity 3D</li>
                        <li>3D Modelling with Blender</li>
                        <li>Dabbled a little in the world of software reverse engineering using ASM</li>
                        <li>and more</li>
                    </ol>

                    but I wasn't satisfied, I've been using programs written by other people and I wanted to know what
                    it would be like creating
                    one of my own. And so started my journey into the world of programming with languages like:

                    <ul>

                        <li>Visual Basic .Net</li>
                        <li>C# .Net</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>and finally Python</li>

                    </ul>

                </p>

                <h2>My Foray into Data Science and Machine Learning</h2>
                I recently discovered a way to satisfy my curiousity about automation in the field of Machine Learning.
                As soon as I found it, I Immediately  started researching about it but my progress was really slow due to very limited resources,
                and the I found <a href="edx.org">EDX</a> and Immediately enrooled in as many courses as i could.
                (I was trying to know everything all at once) and that ended in a disaster, so I decided to take it slow but steady and one day ill get there.
